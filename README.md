# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common problem encountered when using Tailwind CSS gradients and provides a solution.

## Problem

The provided Tailwind CSS code snippet intends to create a linear gradient background using the `bg-gradient-to-r` utility class.  However, the gradient might not render correctly, or might be completely invisible. This could be due to several factors, including incorrect class naming, conflicting styles, or issues with the CSS order. 

## Solution

The solution involves careful examination of the element's classes and ensuring that the gradient classes are correctly applied and not overridden by other styles.
