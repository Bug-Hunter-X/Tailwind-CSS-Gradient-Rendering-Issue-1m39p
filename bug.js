```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's `bg-gradient-to-r` utility class to create a linear gradient. However, if the gradient isn't visible or appears incorrect, it could be due to several reasons. One common issue is incorrect or missing class names.
